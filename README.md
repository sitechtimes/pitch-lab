This project is built with Electron + Vue.js + Vite.

# Project Setup

Every time you make a change and you want it to be reflected on the downloaded app, run:

```bash
npm run dist
```

This will create a new `dist` folder and `dist-frontend` folder with the latest changes while clearing any previous builds.

Then, open the dist folder and drag and drop the .exe file into public/downloads so the new version is available for download.
